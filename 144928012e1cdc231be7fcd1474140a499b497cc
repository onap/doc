      "message": "Hi Andreas Geissler\n\nWe could not complete the validation of the steps in Wiki page because of the issues that we found in deploying the closed loop. This was the reason we mentioned the Wiki link for these steps alone. \n\nWe  had two options: \n\n- Wait until we get a chance to complete them (with the help of the community), add these steps and submit the request again. Since we no longer have this setup (which needs the full ONAP with Openstack), this may take some time. \n\n- Document it partially (up to the point that worked for us), and leave the rest as a pointer to the Wiki page. \n\nWe took the second option, but if that is not the right approach, we can wait until we complete the validation, document the remaining 4 steps (which currently fail for us), and submit the MR again.",
