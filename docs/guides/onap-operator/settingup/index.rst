Setting Up ONAP
===============

.. _installing-onap:

ONAP is deployed using the ONAP Operations Manager (OOM).

The recommended ONAP deployment can be deployed on a private set of physical
hosts or VMs (or even a combination of the two) and is based on Kubernetes,
Docker containers and Helm installer.

Requirements
------------

ONAP deployment via OOM requires the following software components.

* Kubernetes cluster
* Helm
* kubectl
* Docker

The Software versions needed for the specific ONAP release
as well as the minimum Hardware configuration can be found in the
:ref:`OOM Infrastructure Setup Guide<onap-oom:oom_infra_setup_guide>`

Installation
------------

On the target Kubernetes cluster ONAP requires the setup of a Base Platform:

:ref:`OOM Base Platform <onap-oom:oom_base_setup_guide>`

Additional optional setups (e.g. Prometheus) and instructions can be found in:

:ref:`OOM Ingress controller setup (optional)<onap-oom:oom_base_optional_addons>`

:ref:`OOM Ingress controller setup (optional)<onap-oom:oom_setup_ingress_controller>`
