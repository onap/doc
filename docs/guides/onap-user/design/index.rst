Design
======

The goal of the design process is to create all artifacts (models)
that are required to instantiate and manage resources, services,
and products on the ONAP platform. The design process requires
input from users with multiple roles.

Design progresses logically through a series of phases. Each phase:

* is organized into steps that are completed in sequence

* is accessed using a different role with specific responsibilities
  generates artifacts that are used in other phases of design or when
  instantiating or monitoring virtual functions.

The following figure show the different phases and tools involved in
Onboarding, Design and Distribution process.

**The "Core" Design Process includes the following steps:**

* Pre-Onboarding
    A VNF/PNF Provider delivers VNF descriptor, model and
    artefacts (e.g. HEAT template), which will be validated
    and packaged for onboarding to ONAP

* (Resource)-Onboarding
    In the SDC a License Model is created, the VNF/PNF package imported
    and a Vendor Software Product (VSP) is created

* VF Creation and Testing
    A V(N)F, PNF or CR Model is created (a) import of a VSP or VFC
    (b) manual creation and import of artefacts created via external
    tools like the Controller Design Studio (CDS), responsible for the
    Controller Blueprint Design
    The created VF will pass a testing workflow to be used
    in a Service Model

* Service Design
    A Service Model is created as a composition of resources 
    (e.g. V(N)Fs, PNFs,...), Policies, Workflows,...
    The created Service Model will pass a testing workflow and
    handed over to a Governance Approval and Distribution process

* Governance Approval and Distribution
    The Service Provider will have a specific set of policies and
    procedures for approving Services and deploying them in the
    Runtime Service Catalog

**The optional/additional Design steps are:**

* Controller Blueprint Design
    The Controller Blueprint is the overall service design, fully model-driven,
    intent based package needed for self service provisioning and configuration
    management automation. The framework to automate the resolution of resources
    for instantiation and any config provisioning operation,
    such as day0, day1 or day2 configuration.
    It provides a tool called Controller Design Studio

* Policy Design
    The Policy Creation component deals with policies.
    These are rules, conditions, requirements, constraints, attributes,
    or needs that must be provided, maintained, and/or enforced.
    At a lower level, Policy involves machine-readable rules enabling
    actions to be taken based on triggers or requests.

* APPC Controller Design
    APPC Controller Design Tool (CDT) is used for self-service onboarding of
    VNFâ€™s. VNF owners can create templates and other artifacts for APPC
    Configure command (used to apply a post-instantiation configuration)
    as well as other life cycle commands.

* Workflow Design
    The purpose of the Workflow Designer is to enable designers to define or
    modify workflows to support Service/Resource change management scenarios
    executed by the Service Orchestrator.

* Control Loop Design
    This phase includes the Design of a closed loop template and associate it
    to a Service. The template represents the theoretical flow of the CL.
    It generates a deployment artifact that can be ingested by the DCAE in
    order to create the needed DCAE microservices in runtime.
    The design is done in the SDC DCAE-DS (Design Studio).
    The DCAE Design Studio enables to define and configure
    the monitoring flows of DCAE.
    The configuration and deployment of a Control Loop will be done with 
    Control Loop Automation Management (CLAMP) tool.
