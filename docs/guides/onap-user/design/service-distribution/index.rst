Service Distribution
====================

Each ONAP platform operator will have a specific set of policies
and procedures for approving Services and deploying them in the
operator's ONAP environment. This outline describes the general
flow of such procedures.

**Goal:** Add all information required to create, instantiate, and
manage a service in Runtime.

**Tools:** SDC

**SDC user roles:** Designer

   service and click the adjacent down arrow.
   The report shows all components associated with the service and their
   distribution statuses.
#. Review the status of each component.
#. If deploy errors are shown, the reason has to be investigated and the
   Service can be *Redistributed*

Verify that the DCAE Blueprint is Deployed
------------------------------------------

The DCAE controller requires a blueprint (or guideline) to be available
at the site on which the first VNF is deployed. This blueprint is a
management workflow and configuration description for a given VNF, and
it must be available after completing the service distribution process
and before beginning the instantiation process.
