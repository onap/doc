**Context**
===========
From a developer perspective, ONAP can be installed component per component.
For details, refer to :ref:`the installation procedure available for each component<index-setting-individual-components>`.
The advanced installation procedure is recommended only for experienced
developers who desire to focus their attention on a few components and who
have a deep understanding of dependencies between components.
This type of installation is not recommended to fully install ONAP.

* The list of ports used by default within ONAP is documented in `ONAP Service List <https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/ONAP+Services+List>`_.
* The ONAP Source Code is available through Gerrit at https://gerrit.onap.org or Git at https://git.onap.org/.
* ONAP is packaged within Docker and can be dowloaded from Docker Hub at https://hub.docker.com/r/onap.
