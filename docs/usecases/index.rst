Use Cases, Blueprints, Requirements
===================================

Use Cases are descriptions of how a user interacts with a software system to
achieve a specific goal. They describe the actions that the user takes, the
system’s responses, and any conditions or tasks that must be met for the
interaction to occur. Use cases are used to identify and define the functional
requirements of the software system.

Requirements are statements that describe what the software system must do,
how it should behave , and what constraints it must operate under. Requirements
are typically divided into functional requirements, which describe what the
software must do, and non-functional requirements, which describe how the
software should behave or perform.

Blueprint is a high-level design document that provides an overview of the
software system’s architecture and components. The blueprint typically includes
diagrams that illustrate the system’s structure and relationships between
components, as well as descriptions of each component’s function and interface.

ONAP covers a wide range of use cases for Communication Service Providers (CSP)
and the open source networking industry. See the current list of verified use
cases and functional requirements. Upon reaching a certain level of maturity,
use cases become ONAP Blueprints.
