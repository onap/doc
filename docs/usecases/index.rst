Use Cases, Blueprints, Requirements
===================================

ONAP use cases are descriptions of how a user interacts with an ONAP system to
achieve a specific goal. They describe the actions that the user takes, the
system’s responses, and any conditions or tasks that must be met for the
interaction to occur. ONAP use cases are used to identify and define the
functional requirements of the ONAP system.

ONAP requirements are statements that describe what the ONAP system must do,
how it should behave , and what constraints it must operate under. 
ONAP requirements are typically divided into functional requirements, which
describe what the ONAP system must do, and non-functional requirements, which
describe how the ONAP system should behave or perform.

ONAP blueprint is a high-level design document that provides an overview of the
ONAP system’s architecture and components. The blueprint typically includes
diagrams that illustrate the ONAP system’s structure and relationships between
components, as well as descriptions of each ONAP component’s function and
interface.
