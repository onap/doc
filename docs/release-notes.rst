New features
------------

- As part of the LFN cross community guidelines the ONAP documentation project has impelmented the same theme of the docs.onap.org as the the other projects within LFN.
To have one common way of working with documentation as well as publishing has been a key task during the last years.

- Improvning the structure of docs.onap.org to enhace the user experiance. 

- Moving content from the wiki to RTD (read the docs) for better visibility and experiance. Work started and will continue throughout upcoming releases.
