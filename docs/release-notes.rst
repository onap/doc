New features
------------

- Refined and improved parts of the documentation guide.
- Continue with improving the user and admin documentation.
- Minor corrections after the migration.
- In addition the documentation project is continuously working with improving
  processes and tools for documentation. Enabling the community to as easy as
  possible document all the aspects of the ONAP platform. During the Frankfurt
  release cycle we have started the work to clean up available content, both on
  the wiki and readthedocs (docs.onap.org) as well as moving the
  documentation away from submodules according to the LFN documentation
  strategy.
