New features
------------

- As part of the LFN cross community guidelines the ONAP documentation project has impelmented the same theme of the docs.onap.org as the the
  other projects within LFN. To have one common way of working with documentation as well as publishing has been a key task during the last years.

- Improving the structure of docs.onap.org to enhance the user experience.

- Moving content from the wiki to RTD (read the docs) for better visibility and experience. Work started and will continue throughout upcoming
  releases.

All JIRA tickets for the ElAlto release can be found `ONAP Documentation Jira`_
