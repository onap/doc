Documentation Guide
===================

This page describes how documentation is created for the Open Network Automation Platform (ONAP).
ONAP projects create a variety of document types depending on the nature of the project.
Some projects will create detailed technical descriptions such as configuration parameters or how to
use or extend the functionality of platform component.
These descriptions may be together as a reference for that project and/or
be used in documents tailored to a specific user audience and task they are performing.

Acknowledgement
---------------

Much of the content in this document is derived from similar documentation processes used in other Linux Foundation Projects
including OPNFV and Open Daylight.

Getting Started
---------------
ONAP documentation is stored in git repositories, changes are managed with gerrit reviews, and published documents
automatically generated when there is a change in any source used to build the documentation.

Authors create source for documents in reStructured Text (RST) that is automatically rendered to HTML and PDF
and published on Readthedocs.io.
The developer Wiki can reference these rendered documents directly allowing projects to
easily maintain current release documentation.
Read :ref:`this page <include-documentation>` which describes how documentation is created from
ONAP Documentation project (doc) documentation source and other ONAP projects providing source material.

Licencing Your Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All contributions to the ONAP project are done in accordance with the ONAP licensing requirements.
Documentation in ONAP is contributed
in accordance with the `Creative Commons 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_ license.
All documentation files need to be licensed using the text below. The license may be applied in the first lines of
all contributed RST files:

 .. (c) <optionally add copywriters name>

 These lines will not be rendered in the html and pdf files.

Storing Content Files in Your Repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All documentation for your project should be structured and stored in `<your_project_repo>/docs/` directory.
The documentation tool chain will look in these directories when triggered by verify and merge events.

.. index:: master, document

Document Structure and Contribution
-----------------------------------
A top level master_document structure is proposed for organizing all documents
in the four areas as shown below with additional detail under each area.
This structure may change as we gain experience with the first release of ONAP.

Templates
^^^^^^^^^
Where multiple sections with similar content are expected, templates can be created and stored 
under `doc/docs/templates/` and used a starting point for similar content.
For example the high level architecture and interface information for an ONAP component.
A template is a directory name in `doc/docs/templates` and the directory contains at least an
index.rst file with a starting point for creating content and as needed
references to other sources in the template directory.

Project teams are encouraged to reuse and propose new templates for reuse.

Release Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Release documentation is the set of documents that are published for each ONAP release.
The documents have a master index.rst file in the <doc> repository and reference content as needed
from other project repository.
To provide content for these other projects place <content>.rst files in a directory
in your repository that
matches the master document and add a reference to that file in the correct place in the
corresponding master index.rst.
