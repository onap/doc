Beijing Release Notes
=====================
This page is the ONAP Beijing Release Notes. The first release was
Amsterdam and subsequent major release will be named using city names.

* Release Name: Beijing
* Release Version: 2.0.0
* Release Date: June 7, 2018


Getting Started With ONAP
==========================

Summary
-------
ONAP provides a comprehensive platform for real-time, policy-driven
service orchestration and automation including virtual network functions and
applications instantiation and configuration, but also physical network
functions configuration.
ONAP will enable software, network, IT and cloud providers and developers
to rapidly automate new services and support complete life cycle management.
By unifying member resources, ONAP will accelerate the development of a
vibrant ecosystem around a globally shared architecture and implementation
for network automation-with an open standards focus-faster than any one
product could on its own.

Functionality
-------------
**Portal** - a single, consistent user experience for both design timer
and run time environments, based on the user’s role.

**Design Time Framework** - a comprehensive development environment with
tools, techniques, and repositories for defining/describing resources,
services, and products:

 - Service Design and Creation (SDC) provides tools, techniques, and
   repositories to define/simulate/certify system assets as well as their
   associated processes and policies.

 - A VNF Software Development Kit (VNFSDK) and VNF Validation Program (VVP) with tools for VNF supplier
   packaging and validation.

 - Policy Creation (POLICY) deals with conditions, requirements,
   constraints, attributes, or needs that must be provided, maintained,
   and/or enforced.

 - Closed Loop Automation Management Platform (CLAMP) provides a method
   for designing and managing control loops.

 - Optimization Framework (OOF) provides a policy-driven and model-driven framework
   for creating optimization applications.

**Runtime Framework** - The runtime execution framework executes the
rules and policies distributed by the design and creation environment
and Controllers that manage resources corresponding to their assigned
controlled domain:

 - Service Orchestrator (SO) executes the specified BPMN processes and
   automates sequences of activities, tasks, rules and policies needed for
   on-demand creation, modification or removal of network, application or
   infrastructure services and resources. SO is especially able to drive
   any OpenStack-based cloud platform.

 - Software Defined Network Controller (SDNC) executes network configuration
   for cloud computing resources and network.

 - Application Controller (APPC) executes Virtual Network Functions (VNF)
   configurations and lifecycle management operations.

 - Virtual Function Controller (VF-C) is responsible for lifecycle management
   of virtual network functions and network services based on VNF using
   VNF Manager.

 - Active and Available Inventory (A&AI) provides real-time views of a
   system’s resources, services, products and their relationships with each
   other.

**Closed-Loop Automation** -- Design -> Create -> Collect -> Analyze >
Detect -> Publish -> Respond:

 - Data Collection, Analytics and Events (DCAE) collects events, performance,
   usage and publishes information to policy that executes the rules to perform
   closed loop actions.

 - Holmes provides alarm correlation and analysis for Telecom cloud
   infrastructure and services, including servers, cloud infrastructure,
   VNFs and Network Services.

 - Common Services - operational services for all ONAP components including
   activity logging, reporting, common data layer, access control, resiliency, multisite state coordination,
   credential/secret management and software lifecycle management.
   
**Microservices Support** 

 - ONAP Operation Manager (OOM) use kubernetes and Helm to manage ONAP components.
 - Microservices Bus (MSB) provides service registration/discovery,
   external API gateway, internal API gateway, client software development kit (SDK), and Swagger SDK.
