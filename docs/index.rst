Open Network Automation Platform
================================

Open Network Automation Platform (ONAP) is an open source project hosted by
the Linux Foundation.

ONAP provides a comprehensive platform for real-time, policy-driven service
orchestration and automation. ONAP enables service providers and developers
to rapidly automate the instantiation and configuration of physical and
virtual network functions and to support complete life cycle management
activities. By unifying the resources of open source members, ONAP enables
the acceleration of the development of a vibrant ecosystem around a globally
shared architecture and the implementation of network automation faster than
any product could on its own.

Please find some guidance here on the content of the Casablanca Release documentation for ONAP:
