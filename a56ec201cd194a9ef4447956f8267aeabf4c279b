Depth 1 local is useful for local test, but less important in the CI/CD environment and may have some downside depending on how submodules are used.\n\nCan you make this change by:\n- copying the current [testenv:docs] section leaving it and the default envlist environment to run in jenkins unchanged.   \n\n- In the copied section change the name to something like [testenv:local] and make the proposed changes for submodule update.\n\n- Change the documentation instructions that I referenced on patch 1 to show how to use tox -elocal?",
