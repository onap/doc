# Examples files

The examples files for a working (basic) configuration of sphinx should be used
by all ONAP projects (except 'doc' project). Extend them to reflect the needs
in your project. **Important:** The files relate on each other. Change them carefully!

We provide two directories:
- **master**: Contains configuration files used in the **development branch**.
- **istanbul**: Contains configuration files used in the **release branch**
   (e.g.'istanbul'). **Important:** You need to change the 'istanbul' entries
   in the files! Replace them with the name of the new release branch (e.g. 'jakarta').

The additional directories named *_static* and *images* and the file
*index.rst* are required to make the examples buildable. In the respective
directory you can execute the '*tox -e docs*' command and the build starts.
